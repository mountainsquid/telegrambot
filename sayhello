# A simple bot that sends "BEEP BOOP. Good morning ser! to the group"
# BUT you must figure out your group's ID
# This is done by going to api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_API_KEY>/getUpdates 
# Also you need to create a constants.py file and use line: API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY>"

import telebot
from constants import API_KEY

# Giving birth to the bot 
bot = telebot.TeleBot(API_KEY, parse_mode=None)
print('bot is starting up, click, whirrrl')

# Get the chat_id of the group you want to send the message to
chat_id = <> 

# Send a message to the group
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text='BEEP BOOP. Good morning ser!')
